            "(Best months for growing Angelica in United Kingdom - warm/temperate regions)",
            "Angelica is a biennial herb-growing the first year and flowering the second.\nAngelica likes moist, rich soil that is slightly acid, growing best in semi-shade. It can be grown from seeds, but they must be sown within a few weeks otherwise they lose their viability. Angelica will self seed if seed heads are left on the plant.\nYoung plants will die back in winter and will need mulching in frost-prone areas. Then they will grow again in spring and produce flowers.",
            "NOTE: Angelica pachycarpa sold as an ornamental garden plant is not edible. It can be distinguished from Angelica archangelica as it has bright shiny leaves.",
            "The stems can be candied and used to decorate cakes and pastries.\n\r\nPick the stems in the second year.",
