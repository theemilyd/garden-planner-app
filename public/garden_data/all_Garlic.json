            "Garlic is traditionally planted in cold weather and harvested in summer (\"plant on the shortest day, harvest on the longest\"). Plant the cloves (separated from the bulb), point upwards, deep enough to just cover with soil. A fairly tough and easy-growing plant but in better soil with regular watering you will get a better crop. On poorer soil, and forgetting to water them, you will still get some garlic, only not quite so much, maybe just a single large bulb.",
