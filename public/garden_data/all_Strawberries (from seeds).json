            "Sow seeds thinly on seed raising mix/compost. Cover with a thin layer of  compost and water in.\nKeep under cover, either in a greenhouse or indoors near a window. Germination takes 2 to 8 weeks. Plant out into small pots to grow on when 3 leaves have appeared. Then transplant to garden when well grown.\nAfter about a year the strawberries will form low-growing leafy plants,between 12 - 15 cm (about 6 inches) high and will spread to about 50 - 100 cm (20 - 40 inches). They have five petalled flowers, usually white or sometimes pink. The flowers are followed by delicious red fruits which have their seeds on the outside. Later in the season, the plants send out runners like thin stems across the garden. They will take root to form new plants.",

To prepare your bed, dig in some compost before planting and possibly use a liquid fertiliser during the growing season.
