            "(Best months for growing Sweet Potato in United Kingdom - warm/temperate regions)",
            "Sweet Potatoes require a long warm growing season. \nPlant in free draining loose soil.\nFertilise before planting but no more when the plants are growing as it will encourage vine growth. They will go for miles and you will get no tubers. If they do start spreading, lift the vines off the ground to prevent them rooting.",
            "Mound up the soil about 20 cm (8 in) before planting.\nLet the plants die down, (leaves die or turn yellow) before harvesting the tubers. Dry them in the sun for a few days. then store in a cool dry place for up to five months.",
            "Use mashed, boiled, roasted, baked or fried. Or use in soups, pies, casseroles, curries and salads."
