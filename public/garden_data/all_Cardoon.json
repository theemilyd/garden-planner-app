            "(Best months for growing Cardoon in United Kingdom - warm/temperate regions)",
            "Cardoon is a tender perennial from the same family as globe artichokes, grown as an annual for its young leaf-stalks.",
            "Blanch the stems. Tie the leaves together in a bunch and wrap paper or sacking around the stems. Or, form a hill of soil around the stem.\nHarvest four to six weeks after blanching. Cut them off at ground level and trim off the outer leaves.",
            "Cut off the base and leaves, then cut the stalks into pieces.\r\nBoil the stalks for around 20 minutes until tender: drain, and peel off the surface of the stalks.  Add precooked cardoons to a variety of dishes, they go well with mushrooms.",
