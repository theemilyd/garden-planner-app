## Detailed Growing Guides

### Tomato

**Botanical Name(s)**: Lycopersicon esculentum

#### Growing Conditions
- **Soil Temperature**: Best planted at soil temperatures between 16째C and 35째C.
- **Spacing**: Space plants: 40 - 60 cm apart
- **Harvest Time**: Harvest in 8-17 weeks.

#### Growing Tips
- There is nothing like the taste of a freshly picked tomato, warm from the sunshine. In the smallest of gardens or even an apartment with a window-box, it is worth growing at least one tomato plant for the pleasure it will give you. They will grow in pots, troughs or even hanging baskets.
- Tomatoes should be grown in shelter or under cover in cool climates.
- Tomatoes like lots of food! In a garden bed, compost and mulching will produce a crop from one or two plants. In containers, use some suitable long term fertiliser pellets or feed regularly when you water. Feeding improves the flavour of the fruit.
- When you plant out, put the seedlings in a deep holes, up to the top set of leaves. The covered stems will put out extra roots and you will have a stronger, healthier plant.
- There are many different varieties of tomatoes but they all have one of two growth habits.
- Compact bush growth, stops at a specific height and useful for containers. If left without supporting stakes, they will form a dense carpet which excludes weeds and keeps the soil cool and damp.
- Will continue growing a main stem, or vine until stopped by frost. The majority of heirloom tomatoes are indeterminate.
- Both types need stakes to give them some support otherwise they will sprawl across the garden.
- Varieties include Acid-free, Bush, Tall, Cherry, Yellow and many others.

#### Culinary Uses
- Use in sauces, with fried meals, in sandwiches. Can be frozen whole or in pieces.

### Carrot

**Botanical Name(s)**: Daucus carota

#### Growing Conditions
- **Soil Temperature**: Best planted at soil temperatures between 8째C and 30째C.
- **Spacing**: Space plants: 5 - 30 cm apart
- **Harvest Time**: Harvest in 12-18 weeks.

#### Growing Tips
- A hardy root vegetable which grows well in deep cool soil.
- Carrots take about 3 weeks to show themselves and the first leaves look like grass.
- If broadcast sowing, mix with radish seeds which will germinate quickly and indicate the sown area. In hotter or dry areas, water well before seeding then cover with boards to maintain the moisture and cool soil for more successful germination. Check every week or so.
- Over fertilised ground will produce split roots. Protect against carrot fly. It is best to put carrots in a different area of the garden each year for four or five years.

#### Culinary Uses
- Steamed or raw carrots are tasty. Cook them in a small amount of water until nearly dry then add a pat of butter and teaspoon of brown sugar to glaze.
- They can be added to most casserole-type dishes.
- Grate raw carrots and add to salads
