            "Rosemary will grow from seeds but this is not recommended as the success rate is very low. Small cuttings are easy to grow. Put in light, sandy soil where you want your plant to grow or start in small pots and plant out when established.",
            "Rosemary comes from warm Mediterranean areas but adapts well to colder climates. In areas of heavy frost, a cutting potted up and kept in a sheltered spot will insure against total loss of your plant over winter.",
            "Dryness suits rosemary, so well-drained soil and sunshine will be best.",
            "Once established rosemary can be harvested all year round.",
            "Rosemary grows well in patio pots or tubs.",
